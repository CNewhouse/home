    <h1>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Cameron Newhouse, I'm 24 years old. I was born in Escanaba, Mi and raised in Marquette, Mi where I graduated high school in 2016. I love Marquette and everything it has to offer. 
      It's the people and the community that keeps me around. I've been an avid computer user all my life. First introduction to "programming" was in high school, I made my first website with dreamweaver.
      It felt incredible to be able to tell the computer to draw what and how to do so. I knew I was going to go to college for a degree somewhere in the department of Computer Science but never knew specfically what.
      I've occupied a job since my junior year of high school and there has not been more than a month since I was 16 years old where I haven't had a job. My current occupation is a Bartender.
      I believe in work, and I'm always willing to learn. Currently as I write this, I feel as though I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none; especially with college, 
      there are many different courses I've taken that embark numerous computer languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Career Goals:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create projects throughout the summer.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm my senior project.</li>
      <li>Find an internship to further understand scale, workflow, best programming practices, and to expand of resource pool.</li>
      <li>Obtain a certificate.</li>
      <li>Freelance a niche market?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Education</h1>
      <h2>3.5 Semesters completed for a Bachelor's in<br> Mobile Web and Application Development, <br>Minor in Art and Design (focus in Graphic Arts and Web Design)</h2>
      <p>Started attending NMU in 2016. A few breaks and low credit semesters but now I'm back to full time. Unfortunately with technical issues, I lost all my work half way through
        college and when I took a break I didn't save much of my work either. I'm working on getting more projects and assignments uploaded to my Github.
